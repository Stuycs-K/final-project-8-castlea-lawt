## Overview
We will be making an imitation of the short indie horror game ‘Iron Lung’. The game takes place entirely in a small submarine that the player must control with a navigation system, since they can’t directly see outside. The player’s main objective is to travel around the map and take pictures of designated locations. The game can be played in three different difficulties: Easy, Hard and Very Hard. In the hard difficulties, the player will not be able to see the submarine and will have less time to complete all tasks.
## Instructions
Move the submarine around the map according to the degrees of the radar to take pictures at the designated spots(controls below)
   Up - Move in the direction that the radar is pointing to       Left - Adjust the degrees backward ex: 46 -> 45
   Down - Move in the direction opposite to that of the radar     Right - Adjust the degrees forward ex: 45 -> 46
   p - To take a picture
You must take pictures at all designated spots before your time/oxygen runs out. There will be an oxygen bar display on the right of the screen.

Extra Controls
f - To turn flicker mode on/off for the radar's wall indicators
z - To open any secret notes that you have found
