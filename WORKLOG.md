### 5/22/23
Submarine_Tab: //Made constructor
               // functions for getting the positions (x,y) of the Submarine
               //created KeyPress Function for movement and added bounds for that

### 5/23/23
Submarine_Tab: //Resolved error with the Submarine_Tab in that setup() and draw() must be in only one tab
               //changed variables in Submarine_Tab from double to int to match with map

Made Progress Tab: // Added a for loop to check for if there is an img available at that position
                   // changed img arr to img arrlist
                   // Made taskCounter to keep track of how much correct images the player has gotten
                   // Made boolean rightLoco for if right location or not
                   // added error message if incorrest location

### 5/24/23
Progress_Tab; // Resolved syntax issues -> Compiled -> Graphics fits lab screen
              // Can now compare the coordinates of the img at the player location with img from arr
              // Added a couple of test imgs
              // Working on making the Camera method -> Cannot undisplay img in processing -> Step Below
              // Integrated and moved over code from Progress_Tab into Graphics_Tab

Graphics_Tab: // Removed rightLoco and replaced with boolean displayImg
              // Added instance variable of Submarine because it can only use non static methods
              // Moved most of graphics code into a displayScreen() method
              // Moved the Camera method into draw() which I made a keyPressed() for
